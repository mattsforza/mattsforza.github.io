<DIV>Welcome to my Website! I am in my first year and first semester at the University of Maine. I am majoring in Business Administration, and am currently learning how to code in Information Systems.</DIV>

<p>I graduated from Hermon High School in the class of 2018. After graduating from UMaine, my plan is to move somewhere down South and acquire a career in sales or as an entrepreneur. </p>
