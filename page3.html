<h1>Music Preferences</h1>

<div>Along with rapping, Drake produces music, hosts award shows, and does some acting. He was known as Jimmy Brooks on the show "Degrassi" before ever creating music. I prefer Drake as a musician and his talents have increased almost vertically since the start to his career.  </div>
<div>My favorite song currently by Drake is God's Plan. The track released in February of 2018 and has reached 800 million views within the same year.</div>
